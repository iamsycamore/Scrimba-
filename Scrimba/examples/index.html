                <h2> WHAT WE DO</h2>
                <p> I’ve found that taking notes throughout my workday is the best way to stay focused on my to-do list. So many requests come to us from so many directions–emails, phone calls, text messages–that it becomes hard not to get sucked into the busy-but-not-productive whirlwind this creates. Before you know it, the day’s over and only a fraction of your to-do list is finished because you were too busy focusing on tasks that felt urgent, but really weren’t. I find that taking notes as new requests come in help me incorporate them into my future schedule without derailing my plans for that day. </p>

                <p>   Quality notes not only help you build a strong arsenal of knowledge, but they can help make a difference in the lives of those you care about. If a new co-worker needs to get caught up on a project they’re working with you on, they can refer to your notes to catch up without feeling overwhelmed. If a friend misses class due to a family emergency, your notes can help them get back on track. It’s a win-win situation for everyone involved.                 </p>
